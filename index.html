				<p class="pic">Invented in the 1700s, the piano is an instrument of expression, creativity, and timeless beauty. Currently, over a quarter of familes own a piano - and this number continues to grow. The piano is far more than a mere instrument. As a core aspect of musical creation since its founding, the piano is a storyteller, a cultural barometer, a symbol of refinement and a lifelong teacher (pianorentals). The keys of a piano reveal a tapestry of our shared human history that is capable of acting as a bridge to various cultures, generations, and emotions. Whether you want to play piano, explore its history, or discover famous pianists, this site has something for you!</p>
